The folder for each binary contains the prior for a) Chirp mass and b) f_{low} (GW). <br>

In addition to this priors for the rest of the important parameters are identical for each source and are presented below:<br>
<hr>
Symmetric mass ratio: [0.15,0.2495] <br>
Ecliptic latitude: [-90째,90째]<br>
Ecliptic longitude: [0째,360째]<br>
Initial eccentricity: [0.0,0.01] (Sources in Yorsh were not eccentric)<br>
Spin 1: [-0.99,0.99]<br>
Spin 2: [-0.99,0.99]<br>
<hr>

In the inference, one extra parameter was inferred over than in the search, the luminosity distance (Which drops out of the search statistic), the prior for this is:<br>

Luminosity distance: [10,500] Mpc<br>
